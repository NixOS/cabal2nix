#+TITLE: The Future of Haskell Packaging in Nix

* DONE Use Function Application To Escape Override Hell
* DONE Guarantee Consistent Builds and Obsolete =overrideScope=
* DONE Map Cabal Files To Nix Without Information Loss
* TODO Implement Proper Dependency Resolution
* TODO Develop Intelligent Policies for Post-processing and Patching
* TODO Users Need a Configuration Mechanism That Is Both Simpler and More Powerful
* TODO Deal With Infinite Recursions in Test Dependencies
* DONE Set up a Sufficiently Powerful Build Farm
* TODO Define and Publish Processes for Managing the Package Set(s)
* TODO Publish All of Hackage

  We publish 10,745 package versions out of 60,504 available ones, i.e. 18% of
  Hackage. Those packages are selected as follows: we distribute the latest
  version of every package --- 8,764 builds --- plus an additional 1,981 older
  versions that are required by the various LTS Haskell and Stackage Nightly
  package sets we support.

* TODO Generate Differential Build Expressions
* TODO Generate Build Expressions for Hydra
* TODO Add Support for Mega Repositories to =cabal2nix=
* TODO Support Building With =stack=
* TODO Support multi-output derivations

  Put static, shared, and profiled library variants into separate output so
  that we can build everything without forcing users to download all that stuff
  if they just want the regular build.
