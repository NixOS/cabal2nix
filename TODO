* Should we use the github issue tracker for this?

[[
* Include build-tools field in the list of dependencies.

  Example: haskell-src-exts/1.11.1/haskell-src-exts.cabal needs this.

  +1, this is important.

  Done.
]]

* Allow patching the cabal file before processing it. This is required
  to enable/disable cabal flags.

  Example: pandoc/1.8.2.1/pandoc.cabal

  Better approach 1: Allow flag settings to be specified via cabal2nix
    command line.

  Better approach 2: Allow flag choices in the generated Nix expressions.
    Default values in Cabal translate to default values in Nix.
    Then when generating the composition file, select flag choices that
    are appropriate.

[[
* What is Integer-gmp, and is it required? Figure out what's going on in
  'double-conversion'.

  No, integer-gmp and ghc are core packages missing from the core list.
  double-conversion needs a text version more recent than the current
  platform. I wouldn't support it for now.

  Done.
]]

* The ':' at the expression argument list shouldn't be separated with a
  blank.

  According to my coding style, it should. Colon is a binary operator.
  Binary operators should *always* be *surrounded* by spaces.

* networkBytestring doesn't exist anymore.

* Hipmunk has some weird 'm' library as input.

  Well, that'd be -libm. Should be added to the library translation list.
  libm is probably in stdenv. So the type of library translation should
  probably become String -> [String] ...

* terminfo lacks input extensibleExceptions and ncurses.

  extensible-exceptions actually is a core library. It wasn't in ghc-6.10,
  though. I'm not sure what to do here: either remove it as a core package,
  consequently include it where it's a dependency, but set it to null for
  all newer GHCs. Or drop support for ghc-6.10 completely, and keep it as
  a core package.

  The ncurses dependency isn't properly specified in the Cabal file. It'll
  have to be provided externally.

* benchpress lacks a time buildInput.

  Same story for time as for extensible-exceptions above.

* OpenAL lacks an openal build input.

  Another one that isn't specified in the Cabal files.

* SDL-image lacks SDL_image buildInput.

* SDL-ttf lacks SDL_ttf buildInput.

* SDL-mixer lacks SDL_mixer buildInput.

  I looked at these. I think they'll have to be patched. These deps
  aren't properly declared in the Cabal file.

* wxcore needs buildInputs: wxGTK, mesa, libX11.

  Also not in the Cabal file.

[[
* applications/editors/leksah/default.nix generates an infinite
  recursion because the expression expects itself as an argument. Not
  sure why that is happening.

  We should remove a self-dependency of a library. A package providing
  both library and binary can have a dependency on the library from the
  binary. That occurs with leksah. The current flattening includes that
  dep, but it shouldn't.

  Done.
