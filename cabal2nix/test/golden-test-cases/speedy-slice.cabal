description:
  Speedy slice sampling.
  .
  This implementation of the slice sampling algorithm uses 'lens' as a means to
  operate over generic indexed traversable functors, so you can expect it to
  work if your target function takes a list, vector, map, sequence, etc. as its
  argument.
  .
  Additionally you can sample over anything that's an instance of both 'Num' and
  'Variate', which is useful in the case of discrete parameters.
  .
  Exports a 'mcmc' function that prints a trace to stdout, a 'chain' function
  for collecting results in memory, and a 'slice' transition operator that can
  be used more generally.
