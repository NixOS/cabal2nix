version:             0.2.0.0
synopsis:            A generic implementation of dynamic partial-order reduction (DPOR) for testing arbitrary models of concurrency.

description:
  We can characterise the state of a concurrent computation by
  considering the ordering of dependent events. This is a partial
  order: independent events can be performed in any order without
  affecting the result. DPOR is a technique for computing these
  partial orders at run-time, and only testing one total order for
  each partial order. This cuts down the amount of work to be done
  significantly. In particular, this package implemented bounded
  partial-order reduction, which is a further optimisation. Only
  schedules within some *bound* are considered.
  .
  * DPOR with no schedule bounding is __complete__, it /will/ find all
    distinct executions!
  .
  * DPOR with schedule bounding is __incomplete__, it will only find
    all distinct executions /within the bound/!
  .
  __Caution:__ The fundamental assumption behind DPOR is that the
  *only* source of nondeterminism in your program is the
  scheduler. Or, to put it another way, if you execute the same
  program with the same schedule twice, you get the same result. If
  you are using this library in combination with something which
  performs I/O, be *very* certain that this is the case!
  .

  details.
