Synopsis:               HaRP allows pattern-matching with regular expressions
Description:            HaRP, or Haskell Regular Patterns, is a Haskell extension
                        that extends the normal pattern matching facility with
                        the power of regular expressions. This expressive power
                        is highly useful in a wide range of areas, including text parsing
                        and XML processing. Regular expression patterns in HaRP work over
                        ordinary Haskell lists ([]) of arbitrary type. We have implemented
                        HaRP as a pre-processor to ordinary Haskell.
                        .
